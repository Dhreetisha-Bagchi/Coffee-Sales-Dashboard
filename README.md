## The Cozy Grind â€“ Coffee Sales Analysis Dashboard ##

# ðŸ“Œ Business Problem #

The Cozy Grind, a specialty coffee company, sells a wide variety of coffee products across multiple countries. While the company has been growing steadily, 
management faced challenges in understanding:
-- Sales Trends: Which coffee types, roast levels, and package sizes are driving revenue and profit?
-- Customer Insights: Who their top customers are, how loyalty card holders behave compared to non-loyalty customers, and which markets have the most potential for growth.
-- Profitability: Which products are most profitable and whether any underperforming products should be discontinued or promoted.
-- Market Strategy: How to optimize inventory planning, target marketing campaigns effectively, and increase average order value.

To solve this, I developed an interactive Excel dashboard that consolidates sales, product, and customer data into a single, easy-to-navigate view, enabling data-driven decisions.

# ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives
-- Analyze sales performance across time, countries, and products.
-- Identify top customers and their contribution to overall revenue.
-- Compare loyalty vs. non-loyalty customers in terms of revenue and purchase frequency.
-- Discover product-level insights â€“ bestsellers, profit margins, and underperformers.

# ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview

The dataset provided by The Cozy Grind consisted of three key tables:
-- Orders Table: Order ID, Date, Customer Info, Product Purchased, Quantity, Sales, Coffee Type, Roast Type, Loyalty Card.
-- Customers Table: Customer demographic and contact information, country, loyalty status.
--Products Table: Product ID, coffee type, roast type, package size, unit price, profit per 100g.
